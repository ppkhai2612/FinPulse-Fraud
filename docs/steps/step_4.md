# Step 4 - Spark batch: build the enriched fact in `/analytics`

This step stands up [jobs/enrich/build_enriched_fact.py](../../jobs/enrich/build_enriched_fact.py) — a Spark batch job that consumes the entire `transactions` Kafka topic by offset range, joins it with the four `/curated/*` Parquet dimensions from Step 2, adds a `confirmed_fraud` label, and writes `/analytics/transactions_enriched/` partitioned by date. After this step we have one wide table that downstream feature engineering (Step 5) and detection (Step 6) can read without re-doing the joins.

## What this step delivers

| **Artifact** | **Purpose** |
|-|-|
| [jobs/enrich/build_enriched_fact.py](../../jobs/enrich/build_enriched_fact.py) | Spark batch job: Kafka -> join 4 dims -> label -> write Parquet |
| [jobs/enrich/check_fraud_rate.py](../../jobs/enrich/check_fraud_rate.py) | One-shot verifier: prints the global `confirmed_fraud` rate |
| `/analytics/transactions_enriched/dt=YYYY-MM-DD/...` | Snappy-Parquet, ~1M rows, ~30 columns, partitioned by date |

The output schema is the **transaction columns** + **selected fields from each dimension** + the **label**:

```txt
-- from transactions
txn_id, timestamp, card_id, merchant_id, amount, currency,
merchant_category, country, channel, is_international,
-- from customers (broadcast, INNER on card_id):
age, income_bracket, account_age_months, avg_monthly_spend,
home_country, typical_categories, credit_limit,
-- from merchants (broadcast, INNER on merchant_id):
merchant_name, merchant_country, risk_score, avg_transaction_amount,
-- from devices (LEFT on txn_id, sparse):
device_type, os, browser, ip_country, is_vpn, is_known_device,
-- from fraud_reports (LEFT on txn_id, very sparse):
fraud_type, resolution, amount_disputed,
-- derived:
confirmed_fraud, dt
```

## What this step does NOT do

- **No features yet**. No velocity windows, no per-card baselines — Step 5 does that. We're producing the **wide fact**, not feature vectors.
- **No model**. No rules engine, no ML. Step 6 reads this table and produces fraud scores.
- **No streaming**. The Kafka source is read in batch mode (start-offset -> end-offset, then EOF). Step 7 is where streaming comes in, with Flink and event-time windows.
- **No Hive Metastore**. Output is plain Parquet on HDFS. Registering it in HMS so Presto can query it is Step 9, deliberately separated so the catalog/storage/engine split stays clean.
- **No incremental writes**. We rewrite the whole `/analytics/transactions_enriched/` every run (`mode("overwrite")`). The Kafka topic is the system of truth; downstream is rebuildable from it.

## Concepts you'll meet here

- **Spark's Kafka source in batch mode**. Same connector that powers Structured Streaming, but with two extra options — `startingOffsets` and `endingOffsets` — turning it into a one-shot read.

    - `"earliest"` / `"latest"` (string) — read the whole topic, start to end-at-job-start.
    - A JSON offset spec — `{"transactions":{"0":12345,"1":67890,...}}` — pins start/end per partition. Used by Step 7's nightly Spark reconciliation to read exactly the range Flink already consumed, no overlap, no gap. We don't need it yet — `earliest -> latest` is right for the first build.

    The connector is **not pre-baked** into the Spark image (Apache's base image ships Kafka SQL classes but not the runtime JAR). Pass it at submit time:

    ```
    --packages org.apache.spark:spark-sql-kafka-0-10_2.13:4.0.0
    ```

    Spark downloads it from Maven Central into `~/.ivy2/` on first run and caches it.

- **Kafka source schema is fixed**. Whatever you put in, Spark surfaces it as:

    | **column** | **type** | **notes** |
    |-|-|-|
    | `key` | binary | bytes - our `card_id` UTF-8 encoded |
    | `value` | binary | bytes - our `card_id` UTF-8 encoded |
    | `topic` | string | `"transactions"` |
    | `partition` | int | 0–5 (we have 6 partitions) |
    | `offset` | long | monotonically increasing per partition |
    | `timestamp` | timestamp | Kafka's ingestion time (broker-assigned) |
    | `timestampType` | int | 0 = CreateTime, 1 = LogAppendTime |

    Notice `timestamp` here is **Kafka broker's timestamp**, not the txn's event time. The event-time `timestamp` field lives **inside the JSON `value`**.

- **`from_json(...)` with an explicit schema**. Spark can't infer a schema for a `binary` column. You pass a `StructType` describing the JSON shape, and `from_json("value_str", schema)` returns a struct column you can `select("t.*")` to flatten. **Inference is not an option here** — the binary->string->JSON path doesn't see a representative file, only one record at a time. For ~10 columns this is fine; for wider topics you'd Avro/Protobuf-encode and use Schema Registry, but that's overkill at our scale.
- **Broadcast joins**. When one side of a join is small enough to fit in each executor's memory, Spark can ship a copy to every executor and do the lookup locally — no shuffle. Threshold is `spark.sql.autoBroadcastJoinThreshold` (default 10 MB); you can also force it with `broadcast(df)` from `pyspark.sql.functions`.

    - `customer-profiles` (~3 MB Parquet) — broadcast.
    - `merchant-directory` (~200 KB Parquet) — broadcast.
    - `device-fingerprints` (~600K rows, dozens of MB) — regular shuffle join (well above the auto-broadcast threshold; forcing it would OOM workers).
    - `fraud-reports` (~15K rows, tiny) — could be broadcast, but it's LEFT-joined and Spark already auto-broadcasts at this size, so we let the optimiser handle it.

    The win: customers + merchants are looked up against every txn. Without broadcast, Spark would re-shuffle ~1M txn rows by `card_id` and `merchant_id`

- **LEFT vs INNER join, picked by sparsity**. Not every txn has a device fingerprint (sessions can be missing on stored-card rebills), and only ~1.5% of txns ever generate a fraud report. LEFT-joining `devices` and `fraud_reports` keeps every txn in the output; INNER-joining them would silently drop most rows. Conversely every txn must have a card and a merchant — that's a referential invariant of the data generator — so customer / merchant are INNER joins. (If a txn shows up without a matching `card_id`, that's a data-quality bug worth surfacing, not a row to silently drop.)
- **Label leakage warning**. `fraud-reports.timestamp` is the report time, which is always **after** the txn. Using it for a batch label (which is what we're doing) is correct. Using it as a feature for a streaming predictor would mean the model trains on information it won't have at prediction time — the classic label-leakage trap. The output column to leak-check on later is `confirmed_fraud`; everything from `fraud_reports.*` is in the "label, not feature" bucket.
- **Partitioning by `dt`**. `timestamp` is a `string` in the source ("2025-06-15 09:59:52"). Cast to timestamp, then `to_date()` into a new `dt` column ("2025-06-15"), and `partitionBy("dt")`. Cardinality is ~180 (six months of dates) — sweet spot for HDFS partition pruning. Steps 5 and 6 will read whole months in one go; Pinot offline (Step 8) builds one segment per day from this layout.

## Pre-flight

```bash
# 1. /curated has all four dim datasets from Step 2.
docker compose exec namenode hdfs dfs -ls /curated
# expect: customer-profiles, device-fingerprints, fraud-reports, merchant-directory

# 2. The transactions Kafka topic has data in it (Step 3).
docker compose exec kafka /opt/kafka/bin/kafka-get-offsets.sh \
    --bootstrap-server kafka:9094 --topic transactions
# expect: 6 lines, one per partition, each offset > 0,
#         summing to roughly 1M.

# 3. /analytics does NOT yet exist — we create it in 4c.
docker compose exec namenode hdfs dfs -ls /analytics 2>/dev/null \
    || echo "OK: /analytics not yet"
# expected: "OK: /analytics not yet"

# 4. Spark cluster is up.
docker compose ps spark-master spark-worker-1 spark-worker-2
# all three Up.

# 5. Smoke job still works (sanity that HDFS ⇄ Spark is wired).
make smoke-spark
# expect: green "OK: Spark + HDFS integration works"
```

If any of those fail, fix it first. Every sub-step below assumes this baseline.

## Warmup — Read 5 records straight from Kafka in pyspark

Before writing a job file, open an interactive PySpark shell and read five Kafka records by hand.

```bash
docker compose exec -it spark-master /opt/spark/bin/pyspark \
    --master spark://spark-master:7077 \
    --packages org.apache.spark:spark-sql-kafka-0-10_2.13:4.0.0
```

First-run takes ~30s — Spark resolves the connector + its transitive deps from Maven Central into `~/.ivy2/` inside the `master` container. Subsequent runs are instant (cached).

Inside the PySpark shell:

```python
from pyspark.sql.functions import col, from_json
from pyspark.sql.types import StructType, StructField, StringType

# 1. Batch-read every record from `transactions`.
raw = (spark.read.format("kafka")
       .option("kafka.bootstrap.servers", "kafka:9094")
       .option("subscribe", "transactions")
       .option("startingOffsets", "earliest")
       .option("endingOffsets", "latest")
       .load())

# 2. Look at the fixed Kafka-source schema.
raw.printSchema()
# expect: key (binary), value (binary), topic (string), 
#         partition (integer), offset (long),
#         timestamp (timestamp), timestampType (integer)
print("rows:", raw.count())   # ~1M (or whatever offsets sum to)

# 3. Bytes -> strings -> typed columns.
schema = StructType([
    StructField("txn_id",            StringType()),
    StructField("timestamp",         StringType()),
    StructField("card_id",           StringType()),
    StructField("merchant_id",       StringType()),
    StructField("amount",            StringType()),  # JSON-encoded as str
    StructField("currency",          StringType()),
    StructField("merchant_category", StringType()),
    StructField("country",           StringType()),
    StructField("channel",           StringType()),
    StructField("is_international",  StringType()),
])

parsed = (raw
    .select(from_json(col("value").cast("string"), schema).alias("t"))
    .select("t.*"))

parsed.show(5, truncate=False)
parsed.printSchema()
```

A few things worth noting:

- The Kafka `timestamp` and the inside-JSON `timestamp` are **different things** — broker ingestion time vs. event time. We keep the JSON one; the Kafka one is informational.
- `amount` and `is_international` come through as **strings** because the producer wrote `json.dumps(row)` over a `csv.DictReader` row, which has no types. We'll cast in 4a, not here.
- `count()` should match the offset sum from pre-flight check #2

Exit the shell with `Ctrl+D`. The next sub-step turns this round-trip into a proper job file.

## 4a — Skeleton job: read Kafka, parse JSON, sanity-check

Create [jobs/enrich/build_enriched_fact.py](../../jobs/enrich/build_enriched_fact.py). First iteration is the warmup, refactored: read Kafka, parse JSON, cast types, print schema + count. No joins yet.

```python
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession
from pyspark.sql.functions import col, from_json
from pyspark.sql.types import (
    StructType, StructField, StringType, DoubleType, BooleanType,
)

BOOTSTRAP = "kafka:9094"
TOPIC = "transactions"

# Inside-the-message JSON schema — see Step 3 producer.
TXN_SCHEMA = StructType([
    StructField("txn_id",            StringType()),
    StructField("timestamp",         StringType()),
    StructField("card_id",           StringType()),
    StructField("merchant_id",       StringType()),
    StructField("amount",            StringType()),
    StructField("currency",          StringType()),
    StructField("merchant_category", StringType()),
    StructField("country",           StringType()),
    StructField("channel",           StringType()),
    StructField("is_international",  StringType()),
])


def read_transactions(spark: SparkSession):
    """Batch-read the whole `transactions` topic and return typed rows."""
    raw = (spark.read.format("kafka")
           .option("kafka.bootstrap.servers", BOOTSTRAP)
           .option("subscribe", TOPIC)
           .option("startingOffsets", "earliest")
           .option("endingOffsets", "latest")
           .load())

    return (raw
        .select(from_json(col("value").cast("string"), TXN_SCHEMA).alias("t"))
        .select("t.*")
        # producer wrote stringly-typed fields — cast now.
        .withColumn("amount",           col("amount").cast(DoubleType()))
        .withColumn("is_international", col("is_international").cast(BooleanType()))
        .withColumn("timestamp",        col("timestamp").cast("timestamp")))


def main() -> None:
    spark = (SparkSession.builder
             .appName("finpulse-build-enriched-fact")
             .getOrCreate())
    spark.sparkContext.setLogLevel("WARN")

    txns = read_transactions(spark)
    print(f"  read {txns.count()} txn rows from Kafka topic '{TOPIC}'")
    txns.printSchema()
    txns.show(3, truncate=False)

    spark.stop()


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Submit (note the `--packages` flag — without it you get "DataSource provider kafka could not be found"):

```bash
docker compose exec spark-master /opt/spark/bin/spark-submit \
    --master spark://spark-master:7077 \
    --packages org.apache.spark:spark-sql-kafka-0-10_2.13:4.0.0 \
    /opt/jobs/enrich/build_enriched_fact.py
```

Expected:
- `read N txn rows` matches the offset sum from pre-flight
- the schema lists 10 columns with the types you cast (`amount` double, `is_international` boolean, `timestamp` timestamp, the rest string)
- the sample rows

Commit as `step 4a: read transactions from Kafka in Spark batch mode`.

## 4b — Add the four joins

Read the four `/curated/*` Parquet tables and join them with the right strategy for each. The mental model: customers + merchants are **lookups** (broadcast, INNER); devices + fraud_reports are **optional attachments** (shuffle/auto-broadcast, LEFT).

Add four readers (each a Parquet read on `/curated/...`) and an enrichment function. Pre-select only the columns we keep in the output — narrows the shuffle for the LEFT joins and makes the output schema obvious.

```python
from pyspark.sql.functions import broadcast

CURATED = "hdfs://namenode:9000/curated"


def read_dims(spark: SparkSession):
    """Read the four curated dim tables, projecting only kept columns."""
    customers = (spark.read.parquet(f"{CURATED}/customer-profiles/")
        .select(
            "card_id", "age", "income_bracket", "account_age_months",
            "avg_monthly_spend", "home_country", "typical_categories",
            "credit_limit",
        ))

    merchants = (spark.read.parquet(f"{CURATED}/merchant-directory/")
        .select(
            "merchant_id",
            col("name").alias("merchant_name"),
            col("country").alias("merchant_country"),
            "risk_score", "avg_transaction_amount",
        ))

    devices = (spark.read.parquet(f"{CURATED}/device-fingerprints/")
        .select(
            "txn_id", "device_type", "os", "browser",
            "ip_country", "is_vpn", "is_known_device",
        ))

    fraud_reports = (spark.read.parquet(f"{CURATED}/fraud-reports/")
        .select(
            "txn_id", "fraud_type", "resolution", "amount_disputed",
        ))

    return customers, merchants, devices, fraud_reports


def enrich(txns, customers, merchants, devices, fraud_reports):
    """Join txns with the four dims. Broadcast the two small ones."""
    return (txns
        .join(broadcast(customers), on="card_id",     how="inner")
        .join(broadcast(merchants), on="merchant_id", how="inner")
        .join(devices,              on="txn_id",      how="left")
        .join(fraud_reports,        on="txn_id",      how="left"))


def main() -> None:
    spark = (SparkSession.builder
             .appName("finpulse-build-enriched-fact")
             .getOrCreate())
    spark.sparkContext.setLogLevel("WARN")

    txns = read_transactions(spark)
    customers, merchants, devices, fraud_reports = read_dims(spark)

    enriched = enrich(txns, customers, merchants, devices, fraud_reports)

    print(f"  txns: {txns.count()}, enriched: {enriched.count()}")
    enriched.printSchema()
    enriched.show(3, truncate=False)

    spark.stop()
```

Re-submit the same way as 4a.

Two numbers to eyeball:
- **`txns.count() == enriched.count()`**. The two INNER joins (customers, merchants) are on referential keys — every txn has exactly one matching row, so the row count survives. If `enriched < txns`, you've found a data-quality issue (orphan `card_id` or `merchant_id`) or a typo in the join key.
- **The two LEFT joins fan out null-mostly**. `device_type` and `fraud_type` will be null on the majority of rows — that's the point. Confirm with `enriched.filter(col("fraud_type").isNotNull()).count()` — expect ~10K–20K, well below 1M.

Commit as `step 4b: join transactions with the four curated dims`.

## 4c — Add the label and write `/analytics/transactions_enriched/`

Two derived columns:
- **`confirmed_fraud` (boolean)** — `True` when `resolution == "confirmed_fraud"`, `False` otherwise. We coalesce the null case explicitly so the column is never `null` — a missing fraud report means "not confirmed fraud", not "unknown."
- **`dt` (date)** — `to_date(timestamp)`. This becomes the partition column.

Add a `label_and_partition` and `write` functions:

```python
from pyspark.sql.functions import to_date, when


ANALYTICS = "hdfs://namenode:9000/analytics/transactions_enriched/"


def label_and_partition(enriched):
    """Attach confirmed_fraud + dt; drop the report columns we don't keep."""
    return (enriched
        .withColumn(
            "confirmed_fraud",
            when(col("resolution") == "confirmed_fraud", True).otherwise(False),
        )
        .withColumn("dt", to_date(col("timestamp"))))


def write(out_df) -> None:
    (out_df.write
        .mode("overwrite")
        .partitionBy("dt")
        .parquet(ANALYTICS))


def main() -> None:
    spark = (SparkSession.builder
             .appName("finpulse-build-enriched-fact")
             .getOrCreate())
    spark.sparkContext.setLogLevel("WARN")

    txns = read_transactions(spark)
    customers, merchants, devices, fraud_reports = read_dims(spark)
    enriched = enrich(txns, customers, merchants, devices, fraud_reports)
    out = label_and_partition(enriched)

    write(out)
    print(f"  wrote {out.count()} rows to {ANALYTICS}")

    spark.stop()
```

Re-submit the same way as 4a. After the job run completed, quick verification:

```bash
docker compose exec namenode hdfs dfs -ls /analytics/transactions_enriched/ | head -8
# expect: many dt=YYYY-MM-DD sub-dirs (~180), plus _SUCCESS.

docker compose exec namenode hdfs dfs -ls \
    /analytics/transactions_enriched/dt=2025-01-01/
# expect: one or more part-*.snappy.parquet files.
```

Commit as `step 4c: label confirmed_fraud and write /analytics/transactions_enriched`.

## 4d — `check_fraud_rate.py` verifier

[check_fraud_rate.py](../../jobs/enrich/check_fraud_rate.py) is a small job that reads `/analytics/transactions_enriched/` and prints the global fraud rate. This is the rubric check that ties off the step — for the generated seed data, expect roughly 1.25% to 1.35%. Much below that means the fraud-reports LEFT join is not matching; much above that means the label is mis-firing.

Submit Spark job — no `--packages` needed — this one reads plain Parquet from HDFS, no Kafka:

```bash
docker compose exec spark-master /opt/spark/bin/spark-submit \
    --master spark://spark-master:7077 \
    /opt/jobs/enrich/check_fraud_rate.py
```

Expected output on a single replay of the generated dataset:

```txt
+-------+----------+--------------------+
|total  |fraud_rows|fraud_rate          |
+-------+----------+--------------------+
|1149336|14557     |0.012665573861777583|
+-------+----------+--------------------+
```

Commit as `step 4d: add check_fraud_rate verifier`.

## Verification

Run all four checks. The first three are the rubric; the last is sanity.

```bash
# 1. /analytics/transactions_enriched/ exists, partitioned by dt.
docker compose exec namenode hdfs dfs -ls /analytics/transactions_enriched/ | head
# expect: dt=YYYY-MM-DD sub-dirs + _SUCCESS marker.

# 2. Row count round-trips: enriched count ≈ Kafka topic offset sum.
docker compose exec kafka /opt/kafka/bin/kafka-get-offsets.sh \
    --bootstrap-server kafka:9094 --topic transactions
# sum those offsets — call it K.

docker compose exec spark-master /opt/spark/bin/spark-submit \
    --master spark://spark-master:7077 <<'PY' 2>/dev/null
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession
spark = SparkSession.builder.appName("count-enriched").getOrCreate()
print("enriched:",
      spark.read.parquet("hdfs://namenode:9000/analytics/transactions_enriched/").count())
PY
# expect: enriched count ≈ K (equal if the producer never re-ran; otherwise
# they differ by the duplicate count — see Step 3e troubleshooting).

# 3. Fraud rate in the expected band.
docker compose exec spark-master /opt/spark/bin/spark-submit \
    --master spark://spark-master:7077 \
    /opt/jobs/enrich/check_fraud_rate.py
# expect: fraud_rate around 0.0127 on the generated seed data.

# 4. Per the dataflow SoT, transactions still must NOT be in /landing
#    or /curated — Kafka stays the only source of truth for the fact.
docker compose exec namenode hdfs dfs -ls /landing 2>/dev/null \
    | grep -i transactions && echo "FAIL" || echo "OK: no /landing/transactions/"
docker compose exec namenode hdfs dfs -ls /curated 2>/dev/null \
    | grep -i transactions && echo "FAIL" || echo "OK: no /curated/transactions/"
```
